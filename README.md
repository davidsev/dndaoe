# AoE Shapes

An [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.owlbear.app/) extension to work out which squares a cone hits per the rules in XGtE.

## Installation

1. Go to the [Owlbear Rodeo BETA](https://www.owlbear.app/) and click "Add Extension" at the bottom of your profile
2. Add the url `https://dndaoe.davidsev.co.uk/manifest.json`
3. In your room click the `...` menu at the bottom left, and select "Extensions" to enable it

## Usage

A new icon should appear on the toolbar at the right. Click it and then click and drag somewhere to draw a cone. The
squares it hits will be highlighted.

The top toolbar lets you choose between cone/sphere/cube, and access settings. \
Currently the only setting is what percentage of a square needs to be covered to count as being hit. By RAW any overlap
is enough, so the default is 0.
